## Description

This is a job application project. These are the requirements given:

##### Business logic

- Salary Hero can create/read/update/delete (CRUD) a company.
- Salary Hero can add a client admin for a company.
- A client admin can CRUD an employee for that company.

##### Technical Requirements

- Node.js (any framework of your choice).
- PostgreSQL (bonus if you are using ORM).

## Assumptions

- Employees do not need to access the system. Instead they will request a salary advance analogously or in an external system.
- Client admins and Salary Hero admins should both be able to CRUD employees.

## Usage

##### Prerequisites

- Node.js v 15.xx.
- Postgres database.
- A frontend emulator such as Postman or [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) for VSCode.

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. Rename .env.sample to .env and fill out DB_NAME, DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD.
3. Create the genesis company and user:
   1. `npm start` with `NODE_ENV=initial`. This creates the company Salary Hero with id: 1.
   2. Send a POST request to `api/user` with a user object in the body. For example:
      ```json
      {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "john@doe.com",
        "password": "123",
        "companyId": 1
      }
      ```
      - first_name and last_name are optional.
      - email can be any email conforming to Sequelize's isEmail validator.
      - password can be any with `NODE_ENV=initial`. Otherwise it must be between 8-48 characters, both included.
      - companyId must match the id of the company you want to add the user to. In this case, 1.
   3. The request returns a user object, including an accessToken. The token can be used in subsequent requests to the API by setting `Authrization: Bearer <accessToken>` in the request header.
4. `npm start` with `NODE_ENV=development`. This starts the server. You can now send requests to `api/company` and `api/user`.
5. Create a company and a user for that company. This user will have clientAdmin privileges.
6. Start CRUD'ing employees for that company with the user you just created at `api/employee`. Remember to set the Authorization header in the request with the accessToken you received when creating the user.
7. Refer to routes files for additional endpoints and their usage.

NB: `NODE_ENV=production` is only relevant when/if adding a frontend.

## Features

- [x] Account creation.
- [x] Authentication & Authorization with Refresh/Access tokens.
- [x] Protected routes with user roles: clientAdmin and shAdmin.
- [x] CRUD operations for companies, users, employees.
- [x] Filter/query employees by any SQL/sequelize filters.
- [ ] Password reset.
- [ ] Email verification of user accounts.
- [ ] Improved error handling.
- [ ] Add a frontend.

## Technologies

- Node.js/Express.
- PostgreSQL/Sequelize.
- (httpOnly) Cookies.
- jsonwebtoken.

## Challenges

- Implementing a role system.
- Implementing a system for creating the genesis company and user.
- What to do on startup. Should pobably migrate instead of sync.
- Postgres has been challenging as most of my database experience is on No-SQL.
  - Setting up the database.
  - Setting up the relations.
  - Joining data from different tables.
  - Creating new tables instead of nesting properties.

## Further development

The project is ready to be deployed. If setting up a frontend, remember to set `NODE_ENV=production` and fill out `FRONTEND_URL` in the .env file. This is to avoid CORS issues. See Features for ideas on what to implement next. Most important would be the password reset, as new users are not created by themselves, so therefore can not set a personal password initially.
